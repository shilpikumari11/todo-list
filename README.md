# todo-list

Developed an interactive TODOs list web page using <b> HTML, CSS </b> and <b> Bootstrap </b>. Add actions buttons such as add items, delete items and add event listeners on 
those buttons with the help of <b>Javascript </b>. Added items will show in tabular form on another section. Also used <b>JSON module</b> to store items in the form of array
in local storage.
